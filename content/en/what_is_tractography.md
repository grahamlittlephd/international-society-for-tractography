# What is Tractography?

Tractography algorithms aim to reconstruct the structural connections of underlying biological anatomy. In the brain, tractography is applied to reconstruct the brain's white matter structure using diffusion magnetic resonance images (dMRI) that are sensitive to the movement of water molecules inside brain tissue.  Given that water preferentially moves along white matter fibers rather than across them, tractography algorithms can traverse the orientations generated by dMRI to produce streamlines that reflect an underlying map of white matter fiber connections.  To date, tractography is still the only method capable of measuring the brain's underlying "wiring diagram" in living subjects.

The fact that tractography methods can capture a reasonable representation of the true anatomy is considered a scientific feat in itself. However, the current state-of-the-art in tractography is still not a polished technology, hence the society is pursueing large scale collaborative projects to address the accuracy and precision of tractography methods while also increasing the accessibility of tractography for clinicians and non-expert users.
