## What is Tractography?

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractography">Tractography</a> algorithms aim to reconstruct the structural connections of underlying biological anatomy. In the brain, tractography is applied to reconstruct the brain's white matter structure using diffusion magnetic resonance images (dMRI) that are sensitive to the movement of water molecules inside brain tissue.  Given that water preferentially moves along white matter fibers rather than across them, tractography algorithms can traverse the orientations generated by dMRI to produce streamlines that reflect an underlying map of white matter fiber connections.  To date, tractography is still the only method capable of measuring the brain's underlying "wiring diagram" in living subjects.

The fact that tractography methods can capture a reasonable representation of the true anatomy is considered a scientific feat in itself. However, even with the advances in tractography, significant work is needed for tractography to become an established science and adapted for clinical practice. To that end, the society is pursuing large scale collaborative projects to address the accuracy and precision of tractography methods while also increasing the accessibility of tractography for clinicians and non-expert users.

## History of the Society

In 2023, the International Society for Tractography (IST) was established by the founding members of the Board. The idea for an international society originally came from discussions arising during the creation of the <a href="https://shop.elsevier.com/books/handbook-of-diffusion-mr-tractography/acqua/978-0-12-818894-1">Elsevier Handbook of Diffusion MR Tractography: Imaging Methods, Biophysical models, algorithms, and applications</a>. During the writing process it became evident there was a large community of tractography users/developers and a specific need for a proper structure to support collaboration across disciplines to shape the future of tractography developments.

The International Society for Tractography is a non-profit legal entity in Canada listed in the Canadian commercial register.  The society is responsible for the organization of educational workshops, conferences and events, with the broader goal of advancing the field of tractography via large cross-disciplinary collaboration with adjacent fields such as neurosurgery and neuroanatomy among others. The society was founded for the purpose of bringing together developers and users of tractography, to stimulate discussions, improve the technology and to accelerate the transfer of tractography to end users.
