# Board of Directors

The initial board was formed in 2023 to help guide the early years of growth for the International Society for Tractography. The goal of the first board of directors is to do the initial aspects of corporate maintenance and governance that comes with founding a non-profit organization so that the framework is in place to facilitate the scientific goals of the society.

<b>Next Up Science:</b> The next aim is to start shaping the society into an impactful resource for our community (WE NEED YOUR HELP!). We are currently seeking volunteers for leadership positions and input from our community (see below).
