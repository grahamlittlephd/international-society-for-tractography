## The Virtual Brain Observatory

Even though life altering neurological and psychological disorders are known to impact the way the brain is connected, how the brain is wired remains a mystery. Tractography is the only tool capable of mapping the human wiring diagram in living people. To massively accelerate the development and interpretability of tractography techniques, researchers need access to brain images acquired at state-of-the-art resolutions and linked to information about the underlying tissue structure.  The virtual brain observatory will allow researchers to visualize and measure brain connections at multiple scales including long-range and short range brain connections.  This project will be made possible by leveraging the vast experience and resources from members of the International Society for Tractography, for the first time acquiring and packaging state-of-the-art multimodal imaging, tracing and neuroanatomical data into a comprehensive publicly available dataset.
