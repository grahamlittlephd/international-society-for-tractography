## The Virtual Brain Observatory

Even though life altering neurological and psychological disorders are known to impact the way the brain is connected, how the brain is wired remains a mystery. Tractography is the only tool capable of mapping the human wiring diagram in living people. To massively accelerate the development and interpretability of tractography techniques, researchers need access to brain images acquired at state-of-the-art resolutions and linked to information about the underlying tissue structure.

The virtual brain observatory will allow researchers to visualize and measure brain connections at multiple scales including long-range and short range brain connections.  This project will be made possible by leveraging the vast experience and resources from members of the International Society for Tractography, for the first time acquiring and packaging state-of-the-art multimodal imaging, tracing and neuroanatomical data into a comprehensive publicly available dataset.

## Education and Training

Expert knowledge is currently required to perform state-of-the-art tractography research. A mission of the society is lower the barriers of entry to tractography methods by hosting and promoting new educational events designed specifically for individuals of different expertise and backgrounds. These initiatives not only include workshops delivered by world leading tractography experts but also anatomical experts educating tractography developers on the anatomical nuances of the ground truth structural connectivity of the brain.

## Outreach and Translation

The International Society for Tractography aims to increase the impact and reach of this groundbreaking technology with the following initiavies.

- <b>Clinical Translation:</b> Tractography has shown promise for improving clinical outcomes but few centers use tractography in their daily oporations. Through targeted education and research initiatives the society plans to grow the use of tractography for clinical practice and research.
- <b>Fast Track Industry Adoption:</b> Standard MRI protocols developed by vendors are not adequate for performing state-of-the-art tractography. By bringing industry partners into the fold we aim to develop unique solutions that create a "win-win-win" scenario for researchers, clinicians and companies looking to distribute tractography products internationally.
- <b>Facilitate International Education/Collaborations:</b>  This society is fundamentally an international endeavor with members spanning across the role.  All the initiatives of the society aim to be inclusively tackled by researchers from across the globe.
