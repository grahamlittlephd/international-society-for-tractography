<h2>Scientific Committee</h2>

The International Society for Tractography aims to bring together world leading experts spanning a wide range of scientific disciplines while training the next generation of interdisciplinary informed researchers. The goal is to accelerate advancements in the field of tractography that would otherwise not happen at the individual/local level.  To do this the society has adopted an organizational structure for the scientific committee to "get things done" where individual units are ultimately responsible for fundamental aspects of the society's larger scientific goals. The structure and people in charge can be found below.

|Unit Lead: Catherine Lebel|
|Professor, Radiology, University of Calgary|
|<details> <summary> Responsibilities </summary> <div>Tractography has shown promise for improving clinical outcomes but few centers use tractography in their daily oporations.  A large part of this problem relates to the lack knowledge translation between expert tractographers and application/clinical scientists.  The CATT Unit aims to break down these barriers while also bring industry partners into the fold to accelerate the translation of cutting edge tractography techniques to end user impact.</div></details>|
