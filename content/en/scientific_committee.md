<h2>Scientific Committee</h2>

The society has adopted an organizational structure for the scientific committee to “get things done” and achieve our larger scientific goals, where individual units are ultimately responsible for its own specific objectives. The structure and people in charge can be found below.

|<details> <summary> Responsibilities </summary> <div>Tractography has shown promise for improving clinical outcomes but few centers use tractography in their daily oporations.  A large part of this problem relates to the lack knowledge translation between expert tractographers and application/clinical scientists.  This unit aims to break down these barriers while also bring industry partners into the fold to accelerate the translation of cutting edge tractography techniques to end user impact.</div></details>|

To enable more seamless communication across fields, the Interdisciplinary Definitions unit brings together experts from disparate disciplines to standardize terminology that will help guide the fields of anatomy and tractography going forward. </div></details>|

## Leadership Transition Process
<br>
</center>

Our leadership transition process is designed to ensure continuity and mentorship within the International Society for Tractography (IST). Here’s how it works:

### Unit Transition Structure

<b>Start-Up Period</b>: To maintain stability in the early years of the society all unit leads for the scientific committee will serve an initial start-up period of 2 years.

<b>Rolling In & Rolling Out</b>: After this period, a structured rolling in and rolling out process is implemented:
- Past Member: Outgoing unit leads remain on the scientific committee for 1 year as a “Past Unit Lead.”
- Apprentice Lead: Incoming leads (see below) serve as apprentices for 1 year.
- Unit Lead: After the apprenticeship, the unit lead will serve for an additional 2 years.

Each unit lead therefore commits to a minimum of 4 years of service.

### Leadership Transition Steps

<b>President Transition</b>: The President becomes the Past President for 1 year. The Vice-President (VP) is promoted to President.

<b>Vice-President Selection</b>: The Nomination Committee, created by the Board of Directors, shortlists candidates from the current unit leads for the VP position. IST members will then vote to elect the new Vice-President.

<b>Unit Lead Elections</b>: Each unit is responsible for electing its new lead. A current lead can serve a maximum of two terms (4 years).

This process ensures a smooth and effective transition of leadership within the IST, fostering growth and stability in our scientific endeavors.
