From March 10<sup>th</sup> - 16<sup>th</sup> 2024, 47 world leading experts spanning the areas of neuroanatomy, tractography methods and clinical/research applications gathered at the Institut d’Etudes Scientifiques of Cargèse (IESC), Cargèse, France for the first meeting for the International Society for Tractography.  Given the limited space, the select group of individuals were decided based on ample debate focused on diversifying the expertise of those attending as well as ensuring a truly global representation of attendees. The aim of this retreat was to gain a clear understanding of the areas in which tractography needs to improve and can have the most impact.  In addition, the discussions from the retreat helped outline the next steps required for the International Society for Tractography and future meetings.

During the retreat attendees took part in interactive presentations spanning the fields of neuroanatomy, tractography and related neuroscience and clinical applications. While a large portion of the program was dedicated to structured discussion on the high-level successes and challenges of tractography. From this retreat clear objectives were identified and will be set as goals for the field in the coming years. Stay tuned, a more formal release of the output from the retreat will be released in the coming months. We can't wait to include the larger tractography community in shaping the future of tractography development.

Thanks for all those who attended and made this event a amazing success!
