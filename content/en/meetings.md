# TractAnat Retreat<br>Cargèse France 2024

From March 10<sup>th</sup> - 16<sup>th</sup> 2024 47 world leading experts spanning the areas of neuroanatomy, tractography methods and clinical/research applications will gather at the Institut d’Etudes Scientifiques of Cargèse (IESC), Cargèse, France for the first meeting for the International Society for Tractography.  Given the limited space, the select group of individuals were decided based on ample debate focused on diversifying the expertise of those attending as well as ensuring a truly global representation of attendees. The aim of this retreat is to gain a clear understanding of the areas in which tractography needs to improve and can have the most impact.  In addition, discussions will help outline the potential next steps required for the International Society for Tractography and/or future meetings.

During the retreat attendees will be treated to interactive presentations spanning the fields of neuroanatomy, tractography and related neuroscience and clinical applications. While a large portion of the program will be dedicated to structured discussion on the high-level successes and challenges of tractography. The hope is that these discussions will provide clear objectives to tackle in the coming years that will guide the direction of the newly formed International Society for Tractography. We can't wait to witness the outcome of such a unique event and subsequently include the larger tractography community in shaping the future of tractography development.
