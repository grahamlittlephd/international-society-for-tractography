In 2023, the International Society for Tractography was established by the founding members of the Board. These came from discussions arising during the creation of the first edition of the Elsevier Handbook of Tractography.  During these discussions it became apparent that there was a large community of tractography users/developers and a specific need for a proper structure to support collaboration across disciplines to shape the future of tractography developments.

The International Society for Tractography is a non-profit legal entitiy in Canada listed in the Canadian commercial register.  The society is responsible for the organization of educational workshops, conferences and events, with the broader goal of advancing the field of tractography via large cross-disciplinary collaboration with adjacent fields such as neurosurgery and neuroanatomy amoung others. The International Society for Tractography and associated events are not meant to compete with other institutions, organizations and workshops/conferences/events. The society was founded for the purpose of bringing together researchers, developers and users of tractography, in the hope to stimulate discussions, improve the technology and to expedite the transfer of said technology to end users.

The Tract-Anat Society is created to facilitate the financial support and responsibility for the Tract-Anat conferences organization and editing/publishing of the Tract-Anat journal. This can help to provide an upfront loan to future Tract-Anat organizing teams to cover expenses that typically have to be made when organizing a conference before revenues from registration fees and sponsorship agreements materialize. The establishment of the not-for-profit Tract-Anat Society solves this issue.
