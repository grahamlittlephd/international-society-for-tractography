# History of the Society

In 2023, the International Society for Tractography (IST) was established by the founding members of the Board. The idea for an international society originally came from discussions arising during the creation of the Elsevier Handbook of Diffusion MR Tractography: Imaging Methods, Biophysical models, algorithms, and applications. During the writing process it became evident there was a large community of tractography users/developers and a specific need for a proper structure to support collaboration across disciplines to shape the future of tractography developments.

The International Society for Tractography is a non-profit legal entity in Canada listed in the Canadian commercial register.  The society is responsible for the organization of educational workshops, conferences and events, with the broader goal of advancing the field of tractography via large cross-disciplinary collaboration with adjacent fields such as neurosurgery and neuroanatomy among others. The society was founded for the purpose of bringing together developers and users of tractography, to stimulate discussions, improve the technology and to accelerate the transfer of tractography to end users.
